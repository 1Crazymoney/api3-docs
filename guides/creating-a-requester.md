# Creating a requester

Each requester needs to create a requester record, and get assigned a requester index.
This is fairly early, using [`airnode-admin`](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode-admin#create-requester).
A requester index grants you a separate [designated wallet](/request-response-protocol/designated-wallet.md) for each provider.
Note that you can create multiple requester records and get granted multiple requester indices if you wish.
