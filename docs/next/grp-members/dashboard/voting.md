Staking grants DAO members the ability to vote on proposals. Your voting power is calculated by the number of tokens you have staked divided by the total number of tokens staked at the time the proposal was made. This page will show how to use your voting power to vote on a proposal as well as delegating your voting power.

## Getting Started

1. Access the [DAO Dashboard](https://api3.eth.link/)
2. Click the **Connect Wallet** button in the upper right hand corner and connect to your wallet using the mainnet.
