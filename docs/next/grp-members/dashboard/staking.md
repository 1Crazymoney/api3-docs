## Unstaking

When unstaking your tokens, you will initiate a 7 day wait period before you can complete the process in order to prevent evasion of pending claim payouts[...]

Once the 7 day wait period is over, you will have an additional 7 day window to complete the unstaking process and transfer your tokens to your balance.  If you do not complete this process within the 7 day window, your tokens will automatically be re-staked to the insurance pool.
