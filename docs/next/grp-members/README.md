API3 is governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, DAO. Its governance is entirely decentralized and open, meaning that all stakeholders will be able to participate in the governance of the project directly. This will be achieved through the API3 token, which will grant voting power in the API3 DAO when [staked](staking.md) in the [insurance pool](insurance-pool.md).

The DAO will vote on high-level matters such as staking incentives and collateralization. Additionally, the DAO will give out grants from the DAO bank and decide on the general direction of the project. 

## Hierarchical Teams

More granular tasks are conducted through hierarchical team structures for scalable governance.

The expected workflow is to form off-chain teams and apply for grants to execute one-time projects or continuous operations that will benefit API3. The team makes the grant application with a multisig that has the team members assigned as users, and the DAO grants the funds to the multisig if the grant proposal is accepted.

## subDAO

The main DAO governs by selectively allocating funds and delegating authority. When a task reaches a scale that can no longer be fulfilled by a team, it is assigned to a subDAO.
