Staked API3 tokens will be used as collateral for the on-chain insurance service that will provide quantifiable and trustless security guarantees to dAPI users. These mechanics will remove the need for a central authority at the ecosystem level.

By staking tokens to the insurance pool you are granted governance in the DAO, which gives you voting rights on active DAO proposals and inflationary rewards.

Staking simply means you are placing API3 tokens into the insurance pool. You can stake as many times as youâ€™d like. Your percentage of all the tokens in the insurance pool are directly related to your percentage of the rewards and the risks. If you stake 10% of the pool you earn 10% of rewards and will pay 10% of insurance claims.
