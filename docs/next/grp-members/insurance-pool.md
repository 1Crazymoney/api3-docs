API3 will provide dAPI users with a quantifiable level of security in the form of an
on-chain insurance service. This accomplishes two goals:

- the insurance acts as a
well-defined and trustless safety net for the user in case of a dAPI malfunction
-  it holds the governing parties responsible for dAPI malfunctions, and thus incentivizes them to govern towards more secure dAPIs.



## On-chain insurance service

API3 will co-develop an on-chain insurance service with Kleros that provides quantifiable and trustless security guarantees to dAPI users. This insurance service will protect the dAPI user against damages caused by certain dAPI malfunctions up to a payout limit. Note that even if we did not provide this service, the dAPI user
could have received on-chain insurance services using a third party solution.
Such a solution would tend towards charging very high insurance premiums, as they
would not have access to the information and expertise to accurately assess dAPI
risks.

The proposed insurance service is special in the way that it is collateralized by the funds staked by the governing parties of the API3 DAO. Therefore, it not only provides security guarantees to the dAPI user, but also creates a very strong incentive for dAPIs to be governed in a way that their security is maximized, which will further decrease insurance costs.

## Staking

By [staking](tokens.md#staked-tokens) your API3 tokens into the insurance staking pool, you take part in providing API3 users with quantifiable security guarantees in the form of insurance. Insurance staking pool funds are used to cover potential financial losses from dAPI malfunctions that the dAPI consumer might incur. As you stake API3 to the insurance pool, you generate shares in the API3 DAO.
